    <p>"Young lady, get on your Twitter account.
      We're doing this whole broadcast on the fly.
      Will doesn't have a rundown, it's the EP's first show, and she's got the whole thing in her head.
      She's the only one who knows where we're going next.
      It's a feat that requires incredible trust between the anchor and the EP.
      Say all that.""

  <p> "Anchors having an opinion isn't a new phenomenon.
    Murrow had one and that was the end of McCarthy.
    Cronkite had one and that was the end of Vietnam."
    "I'm not those guys.""
    "I'm betting all my money on you're wrong.

  <p> Have some Hamlet: To be, or not to be: that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; no more; and, by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause.
